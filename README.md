## Inspiration
Research suggests that an average person has an attention span of 3 minutes. This means it is very hard to stay attentive for a long amount of time. This is also the reason that even after hours of studying retaining information is difficult. We wanted to design a web app that helps students study smarter not harder.

## What it does
Our web app translates pictures of notes into flashcards. It also provides a functionality that tests your knowledge on the material by providing educational games to play. These tests questions are based on the flashcards made from user notes. It compacts the amount of time spent studying. It reinforces engagement with the material.

## How we built it
We started off by building the front end such as the website itself and the flashcards in ReactJS. The photo reading system is implemented using Microsoft's Azure computer vision technology. The data from the notes is stored in Mongodb using flask, This data is extracted by ReactJS to make flashcards for the user. The learning game is also implemented using Unity 3D and C#.

## Challenges we ran into
We started off not knowing how to code in React JS, one of the bigger challenges was to implement the whole front end in the system we were not familiar with. Understanding the functionalities and being able to parse the documents in a meaningful way and order them into appropriate terms and definition was also a hurdle in our way. For the game implementation, we faced troubles displaying the answers, cycling through them and building, compiling and hosting the game on a web page. We also faced challenge in extracting the data and displaying it on the front end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of getting a profound understanding in ReactJS and being able to build and deploy the whole frontend in a new system we did not know how to use. We made a multi-faceted studying web app.

## What we learned
ReactJS Frontend Backend Connecting and setting up a MongoDB Connecting Flask and ReactJS Azure Services Unit Lists

## What's next for KNOWtes
We are really excited to build new and improved features such as building new games, keeping statistics on scores and user performance and also ability to edit the terms and definition.
